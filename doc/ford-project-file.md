You can have as many paragraphs as you like here and can use headlines, links,
images, etc. Basically, you can use anything in Markdown and Markdown-Extra.
Furthermore, you can insert LaTeX into your documentation. So, for example,
you can provide inline math using like \( y = x^2 \) or math on its own line
like \[ x = \sqrt{y} \] or $$ e = mc^2. $$ You can even use LaTeX environments!
So you can get numbered equations like this:
\begin{equation}
  PV = nRT
\end{equation}
